# Stock Intake Telegram Bot

The goal of this project is to create a stock intake system that enables
users to perform basic functions for handling inventory such as
loaning out items and registering new items.

All transactions are logged for accountability and access to the bot is secured
through role based access control.

Transactions are initiated through the telegram bot.
